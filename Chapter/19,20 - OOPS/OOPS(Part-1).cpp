OOPS - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1. Encapsulation 
2. Inheritance   
3. Polymorphism  
4. Abstraction   

- Classes is a blueprint for creating objects
- Objects are instances of classes

* Access Modifiers :
1. public   : can be accessed anywhere
2. private  : can be accessed only within the class
3. protected: can be accessed within the class and its derived classes

* Getter and Setter :
1. Getter : to get the value of a private variable
2. Setter : to set the value of a private variable


-> Encapsulation : is the process of wrapping up data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit. 
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).

* cunstructor : a special member function of a class that is called automatically when an object of that class is created.
 Type of cunstructor : 
1. default(Non-parameterized)
2. parameterized 
3. copy
   - Shallow copy : creates a copy of the object (Static) (Dynamic pointer points to the same memory location)
   - Deep copy    : creates a new object with the same data as the original object (Dynamic pointer points to a new memory location)

* Destructor : a special member function of a class that is called automatically when an object of that class is destroyed.


-> Inheritance : is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties (methods and variables) of another class.
Types of inheritance :
1. Single inheritance
2. Multiple inheritance
3. Multilevel inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance

* Mode of inheritance :
1. Public mode :
    All the public members of the base class become public members of the derived class.
    All the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.
    All the private members are not accessible from the derived class.
2. Private mode :
    All the public members of the base class become private members of the derived class.
    All the protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class.
    All the private members are not accessible from the derived class.
3. Protected mode :
    All the public members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.
    All the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class.
    All the private members are not accessible from the derived class.
